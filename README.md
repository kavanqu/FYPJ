# FYPJ
GenAI-based Smart Searching Engine for Document Retrieval and Decision Recommendation Project

# Project Description
Industry Project for Land Transport Authority (LTA)
Currently, LTA need to read through a lot of documents every year and with their current system they are only able to filter by reference number, submission number and project reference number making it difficult to find related documents.

# Problems
The Submission Processing Module (SPM) lacks critical features such as:
  - Retrieval using keyword search.
  - Smart decision recommendation system for waiver cases.
  - Advanced filtering and refining of search results.
  - Need for integrating geospatial insights with document retrieval processes.

# Objecitve
The Project Objective are:
  - Implement text extraction from PDFs and images (*).
  - Enable structured queries for specific retrieval needs (*).
  - Introduce advanced search capabilities, including:
    - Keyword search for targeted results.
    - Semantic search for broader relevance.
    - Filtering options for refined exploration (*).
  - Develop a decision recommendation system leveraging past cases and regulations (*).
  - Provide intuitive results visualization on a Singapore-based map interface (*).
